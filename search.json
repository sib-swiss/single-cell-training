    "text": "Exercises\nLoad the following packages:\n\nlibrary(celldex)\nlibrary(SingleR)\n\nIn the last exercise we saw that probably clustering at a resolution of 0.3 gave the most sensible results. Let’s therefore set the default identity of each cell based on this clustering:\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::SetIdent(seu, value = seu$RNA_snn_res.0.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFrom now on, grouping (e.g. for plotting) is done by the active identity (set at @active.ident) by default.\n\n\nDuring cell annotation we will use the original count data (not the integrated data):\n\nDefaultAssay(seu) &lt;- \"RNA\"\n\nBased on the UMAP we have generated, we can visualize expression for a gene in each cluster:\n\nSeurat::FeaturePlot(seu, \"HBA1\")\n\n\n\n\nBased on expression of sets of genes you can do a manual cell type annotation. If you know the marker genes for some cell types, you can check whether they are up-regulated in one or the other cluster. Here we have some marker genes for two different cell types:\n\ntcell_genes &lt;- c(\"IL7R\", \"LTB\", \"TRAC\", \"CD3D\")\nmonocyte_genes &lt;- c(\"CD14\", \"CST3\", \"CD68\", \"CTSS\")\n\nLet’s have a look at the expression of the four T cell genes:\n\nSeurat::FeaturePlot(seu, tcell_genes, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\nThese cells are almost all in cluster 0 and 8. Which becomes clearer when looking at the violin plot:\n\nSeurat::VlnPlot(seu,\n                features = tcell_genes,\n                ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nHave a look at the monocyte genes as well. Which clusters contain probably monocytes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeurat::FeaturePlot(seu, monocyte_genes, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\nSeurat::VlnPlot(seu,\n                features = monocyte_genes,\n                ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also automate this with the function AddModuleScore. For each cell, an expression score for a group of genes is calculated:\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::AddModuleScore(seu,\n                              features = list(tcell_genes),\n                              name = \"tcell_genes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAfter running AddModuleScore, a column was added to seu@meta.data.\nA. What is the name of that column? What kind of data is in there?\nB. Generate a UMAP with color accoding to this column and a violinplot grouped by cluster. Is this according to what we saw in the previous exercise?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nA. The new column is called tcell_genes1. It contains the module score for each cell (which is basically the average expression of the set of genes).\nB. You can plot the UMAP with\n\nSeurat::FeaturePlot(seu, \"tcell_genes1\")\n\n\n\n\nWhich indeed shows these genes are mainly expressed in clusters 0 and 8:\n\nSeurat::VlnPlot(seu,\n                \"tcell_genes1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotating cells according to cycling phase\nBased on the same principle, we can also annotate cell cycling state. The function CellCycleScore uses AddModuleScore to get a score for the G2/M and S phase (the mitotic phases in which cell is cycling). In addition, CellCycleScore assigns each cell to either the G2/M, S or G1 phase.\nFirst we extract the built-in genes for cell cycling:\n\ns.genes &lt;- Seurat::cc.genes.updated.2019$s.genes\ng2m.genes &lt;- Seurat::cc.genes.updated.2019$g2m.genes\n\nNow we run the function:\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::CellCycleScoring(seu,\n                                s.features = s.genes,\n                                g2m.features = g2m.genes)\n\nAnd we can visualize the annotations:\n\nSeurat::DimPlot(seu, group.by = \"Phase\")\n\n\n\n\nBased on your application, you can try to regress out the cell cycling scores at the step of scaling. Reasons for doing that could be:\n\nMerging cycling and non-cycling cells of the same type in one cluster\nMerging G2/M and S phase in one cluster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that correcting for cell cycling is performed at the scaling step. It will therefore only influence analyses that use scaled data, like dimensionality reduction and clustering. For e.g. differential gene expression testing, we use the raw original counts (not scaled).\n\n\nHere, we choose not to regress out either of them. Because we are looking at developing cells, we might be interested to keep cycling cells seperated. In addition, the G2/M and S phases seem to be in the same clusters. More info on correcting for cell cycling here.\nCell type annotation using SingleR\n\nTo do a fully automated annoation, we need a reference dataset of primary cells. Any reference could be used. The package scRNAseq in Bioconductor includes several scRNAseq datasets that can be used as reference to SingleR. One could also use a reference made of bulk RNA seq data. Here we are using the a hematopoietic reference dataset from celldex. Check out what’s in there:\n\nref &lt;- celldex::NovershternHematopoieticData()\nclass(ref)\ntable(ref$label.main)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will be asked whether to create the directory /home/rstudio/.cache/R/ExperimentHub. Type yes as a response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can find more information on different reference datasets at the celldex documentation\n\n\nNow SingleR compares our normalized count data to a reference set, and finds the most probable annation:\n\nseu_SingleR &lt;- SingleR::SingleR(test = Seurat::GetAssayData(seu),\n                                ref = ref,\n                                labels = ref$label.main)\n\nSee what’s in there by using head:\n\nhead(seu_SingleR)\n\nDataFrame with 6 rows and 4 columns\n                                                   scores          labels\n                                                 &lt;matrix&gt;     &lt;character&gt;\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1 0.216202:0.197296:0.086435:...

They are usually not of interest, and they clogg our plots. Therefore we remove them from the annotation:\n\nsingleR_labels &lt;- seu_SingleR$labels\nt &lt;- table(singleR_labels)\nother &lt;- names(t)[t &lt; 10]\nsingleR_labels[singleR_labels %in% other] &lt;- \"none\"\n\nIn order to visualize it in our UMAP, we have to add the annotation to seu@meta.data:\n\nseu$SingleR_annot &lt;- singleR_labels\n\nWe can plot the annotations in the UMAP. Here, we use a different package for plotting (dittoSeq) as it has a bit better default coloring, and some other plotting functionality we will use later on.\n\ndittoSeq::dittoDimPlot(seu, \"SingleR_annot\", size = 0.7)\n\n\n\n\nWe can check out how many cells per sample we have for each annotated cell type:\n\ndittoSeq::dittoBarPlot(seu, var = \"SingleR_annot\", group.by = \"orig.ident\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nCompare our manual annotation (based on the set of T cell genes) to the annotation with SingleR. Do they correspond?\n\n\n\nYou can for example use the plotting function dittoBarPlot to visualize the cell types according to cluster (use RNA_snn_res.0.3 in stead of orig.ident))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can have a look at the mean module score for each SingleR annotation like this:\n\ndittoSeq::dittoBarPlot(seu, \n                       var = \"SingleR_annot\", \n                       group.by = \"RNA_snn_res.0.3\")\n\n\n\n\nHere, you can see that cluster 0 and 8 contain cells annotated as T cells (CD4+ and CD8+).\n\n\n\nSave the dataset and clear environment\nNow, save the dataset so you can use it tomorrow:\n\nsaveRDS(seu, \"seu_day2-4.rds\")\n\nClear your environment:\n\nrm(list = ls())\ngc()\n.rs.restartR()"

    "text": "Exercises\nNormalization\nAfter removing unwanted cells from the dataset, the next step is to normalize the data. By default, Seurat employs a global-scaling normalization method \"LogNormalize\" that normalizes the feature expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, multiplies this by a scale factor (10,000 by default), and log-transforms the result. Normalized values are stored in the “RNA” assay (as item of the @assay slot) of the seu object.\nThis is how you can call the function (don’t run it yet! Read the exercise first):\n\n# Don't run it yet! Read the exercise first\nseu &lt;- Seurat::NormalizeData(seu,\n                     normalization.method = \"LogNormalize\",\n                     scale.factor = 10000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nHave a look at the assay data before and after running NormalizeData(). Did it change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can extract assay data with the function Seurat::GetAssayData. By default, the slot data is used (inside the slot assay), containing normalized counts. Use Seurat::GetAssayData(seu, slot = \"counts\") to get the raw counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can check out some assay data with:\n\nSeurat::GetAssayData(seu)[1:10,1:10]  \n\nReturning:\n\n\nBefore normalization\nAfter normalization\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning in GetAssayData.StdAssay(object = object[[assay]], layer = layer): data\nlayer is not found and counts layer is used\n\n\n10 x 10 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n\n\n  [[ suppressing 10 column names 'PBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1', 'PBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1', 'PBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1' ... ]]\n\n\n                                 \nRP11-34P13.7  . . . . . . . . . .\nFO538757.3    . . . . . . . . . .\nFO538757.2    1 . . . . . 2 . . .\nAP006222.2    . . . . . . . . . .\nRP4-669L17.10 . . . . . . . . . .\nRP5-857K21.4  . . . . . . . . . .\nRP11-206L10.9 . . . . . . . . . .\nLINC00115     . . . . . . . . . .\nFAM41C        . . . . . . . . . .\nRP11-54O7.1   . . . . . . . . . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalizing layer: counts\n\n\n10 x 10 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n\n\n  [[ suppressing 10 column names 'PBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1', 'PBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1', 'PBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1' ... ]]\n\n\n                                               \nRP11-34P13.7  .        . . . . . .        . . .\nFO538757.3    .        . . . . . .        . . .\nFO538757.2    1.641892 . . . . . 1.381104 . . .\nAP006222.2    .        . . . . . .        . . .\nRP4-669L17.10 .        . . . . . .        . . .\nRP5-857K21.4  .        . . . . . .        . . .\nRP11-206L10.9 .        . . . . . .        . . .\nLINC00115     .        . . . . . .        . . .\nFAM41C        .        . . . . . .        . . .\nRP11-54O7.1   .        . . . . . .        . . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating seu\n\n\n\nAs you might have noticed, this function takes the object seu as input, and it returns it to an object named seu. We can do this because the output of such calculations are added to the object, without loosing information.\n\n\nVariable features\nWe next calculate a subset of features that exhibit high cell-to-cell variation in the dataset (i.e, they are highly expressed in some cells, and lowly expressed in others). Focusing on these genes in downstream analysis helps to highlight biological signal in single-cell datasets. The procedure in Seurat models the mean-variance relationship inherent in single-cell data, and is implemented in the FindVariableFeatures() function. By default, 2,000 genes (features) per dataset are returned and these will be used in downstream analysis, like PCA.\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::FindVariableFeatures(seu,\n                            selection.method = \"vst\",\n                            nfeatures = 2000)\n\nFinding variable features for layer counts\n\n\nLet’s have a look at the 10 most variable genes:\n\n# Identify the 10 most highly variable genes\ntop10 &lt;- head(Seurat::VariableFeatures(seu), 10)\ntop10\n\n [1] \"IGKC\"   \"HBG2\"   \"IGHG3\"  \"IGHG1\"  \"JCHAIN\" \"HBG1\"   \"IGHA1\"  \"IGHGP\" \n [9] \"IGLC2\"  \"IGLC3\" \n\n\nWe can plot them in a nicely labeled scatterplot:\n\nvf_plot &lt;- Seurat::VariableFeaturePlot(seu)\nSeurat::LabelPoints(plot = vf_plot,\n            points = top10, repel = TRUE)\n\nWhen using repel, set xnudge and ynudge to 0 for optimal results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the plotting window is large enough\n\n\n\nThe function LabelPoints will throw an error if the plotting window is to small. If you get an error, increase plotting window size in RStudio and try again.\n\n\nYou can see that most of the highly variables are antibody subunits (starting with IGH, IGL). Not very surprising since we look at bone marrow tissue. We can have a look later in which cells they are expressed.\nScaling\nNext, we apply scaling, a linear transformation that is a standard pre-processing step prior to dimensional reduction techniques like PCA. The ScaleData() function\n\nshifts the expression of each gene, so that the mean expression across cells is 0\nscales the expression of each gene, so that the variance across cells is 1\n\nThis step gives equal weight in downstream analyses, so that highly-expressed genes do not dominate. The results of this are stored in seu$RNA@scale.data\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::ScaleData(seu)\n\nCentering and scaling data matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of Seurat::SCTransform\n\n\n\nThe functions NormalizeData, VariableFeatures and ScaleData can be replaced by the function SCTransform. The latter uses a more sophisticated way to perform the normalization and scaling, and is argued to perform better. However, it is slower, and a bit less transparent compared to using the three separate functions. Therefore, we chose not to use SCTransform for the exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus exercise\n\n\n\nRun SCTransform on the seu object. Where is the output stored?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can run it like so:\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::SCTransform(seu)\n\nAnd it will add an extra assay to the object. names(seu@assays) returns:\n\n\n[1] \"RNA\" \"SCT\"\n\n\nMeaning that a whole new assay was added (including the sparse matrices with counts, normalized data and scaled data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRunning SCTransform will change @active.assay into SCT(in stead of RNA; check it with DefaultAssay(seu)). This assay is used as a default for following function calls. To change the active assay to RNA run:\n\nDefaultAssay(seu) &lt;- \"RNA\"\n\n\n\nSave the dataset and clear environment\nNow, save the dataset so you can use it tomorrow:\n\nsaveRDS(seu, \"seu_day1-3.rds\")\n\nClear your environment:\n\nrm(list = ls())\ngc()\n.rs.restartR()"

These exercises are not essential to run for the rest of the course, so you can skip them. If you want to do them anyway, you can try to install cellranger locally (only on Linux or WSL). In addition, you will need to download the references. You can get it by with this code (choose your OS):\n\nLinux/MacOS/WSLWindows\n\n\nwget https://single-cell-transcriptomics.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cellranger_index.tar.gz\ntar -xvf cellranger_index.tar.gz\nrm cellranger_index.tar.gz\n\n\nDownload using the link, and unpack in your working directory.\n\n\n\nThis will download and extract the index in the current directory. Specify the path to this reference in the exercises accordingly.\n\n\nHave a look in the directory course_data/reads and /data/cellranger_index. In the reads directory you will find reads on one sample: ETV6-RUNX1_1. In the analysis part of the course we will work with six samples, but due to time and computational limitations we will run cellranger count on one of the samples, and only reads originating from chromsome 21 and 22.\nThe input you need to run cellranger count are the sequence reads and a reference. Here, we have prepared a reference only with chromosome 21 and 22, but in ‘real life’ you would of course get the full reference genome of your species. The reference has a specific format. You can download precomputed human and mouse references from the 10X website. If your species of interest is not one of those, you will have to generate it yourself. For that, have a look here.\nTo be able to run cellranger in the compute environment, first run:\nexport PATH=/data/cellranger-8.0.1:$PATH\nHave a look at the documentation of cellranger count (scroll down to Command-line argument reference).\nYou can find the input files here:\n\nreads: /home/rstudio/single_cell_course/course_data/reads/ (from the downloaded tar package in your home directory)\npre-indexed reference: /data/cellranger_index\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nFill out the missing arguments (at FIXME) in the script below, and run it:\ncellranger count \\\n--id=FIXME \\\n--sample=FIXME \\\n--transcriptome=FIXME \\\n--fastqs=FIXME \\\n--localcores=4 \\\n--create-bam=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will take a while..\n\n\n\nOnce started, the process will need approximately 15 minutes to finish. Have a coffee and/or have a look at the other exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning a bash command with Rstudio\n\n\n\nYou can run a bash script or command using the terminal tab in Rstudio server:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\ncellranger count \\\n--id=ETV6-RUNX1_1 \\\n--sample=ETV6-RUNX1_1 \\\n--transcriptome=/data/cellranger_index \\\n--fastqs=/home/rstudio/single_cell_course/course_data/reads \\\n--localcores=4 \\\n--create-bam=true\n\n\n\nHave a look out the output directory (i.e. ~/ETV6-RUNX1_1/outs). The analysis report (web_summary.html) is usually a good place to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen html files in Rstudio server\n\n\n\nYou can use the file browser in the bottom right (tab “Files”) to open html files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nHave a good look inside web_summary.html. Anything that draws your attention? Is this report good enough to continue the analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nNot really. First of all there is a warning: Fraction of RNA read bases with Q-score &gt;= 30 is low. This means that there is a low base quality of the reads. A low base quality gives results in more sequencing error and therefore possibly lower performance while mapping the reads to genes. However, a Q-score of 30 still represents 99.9% accuracy.\nWhat should worry us more is the number of reads per cell (363) and the sequencing saturation (7.9%). In most cases you should aim for 30.000 - 50.000 reads per cell (depending on the application). We therefore don’t have enough reads per cell. However, as you might remember, this was a subset of reads (1 million) mapped against chromosome 21 & 22, while the original dataset contains 210,987,037 reads. You can check out the original report at course_data/count_matrices/ETV6-RUNX1_1/outs/web_summary.html.\nFor more info on sequencing saturation, have a look here."

Note that you will need administrator rights, and that if you are using Windows, you need the latest version of Windows 10.\n\nThe command to run the environment required for this course looks like this (in a terminal):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify the script\n\n\n\nThe home directory within the container is mounted to your current directory ($PWD), if you want to change this behaviour, modify the path after -v to the working directory on your computer before running it.\n\n\n\ndocker run \\\n--rm \\\n-p 8787:8787 \\\n-e PASSWORD=test \\\n-v $PWD:/home/rstudio \\\ngeertvangeest/single-cell-rstudio:latest\n\nIf this command has run successfully, approach Rstudio server like this:\nhttp://localhost:8787\nCopy this URL into your browser. If you used the snippet above, the credentials will be:\n\n\nUsername: rstudio\n\n\nPassword: test\n\n\nGreat! Now you will be able to use Rstudio with all required installations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the options\n\n\n\nThe option -v mounts a local directory in your computer to the directory /home/rstudio in the docker container (‘rstudio’ is the default user for Rstudio containers). In that way, you have files available both in the container and on your computer. Use this directory on your computer. Change the first path to a path on your computer that you want to use as a working directory.\nThe part geertvangeest/single-cell-rstudio:latest is the image we are going to load into the container. The image contains all the information about software and dependencies needed for this course. When you run this command for the first time it will download the image. Once it’s on your computer, it will start immediately.\n\n\n\n\nTo simply run the environment, you can use renku. You can find the repository (including the image) here: https://renkulab.io/projects/geert.vangeest/single-cell-training/.\n\n\n\nCreate a project\nNow that you have access to an environment with the required installations, we will set up a project in a new directory. On the top right choose the button Project (None) and select New Project…\n\nContinue by choosing New Directory\n\nAs project type select New Project\n\nFinally, type in the project name. This should be single_cell_course. Finish by clicking Create Project.\n\nNow that we have setup a project and a project directory (it is in /home/rstudio/single_cell_course), we can download the data that is required for this course. We will use the built-in terminal of Rstudio.

    "text": "Exercises\nLoading scRNAseq data\nThe next step after the generation of the count matrices with cellranger count, is the data analysis. The R package Seurat is currently the most popular software to do this. To start working with Seurat you can load it into your environment like this:\n\nlibrary(Seurat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: make an R script\n\n\n\nYou could type and copy-paste the commands of these exercises directly in the console. However, that makes it hard to track what you have done. In addition, it can be nice to add comments to your code, so you can read back why you have made certain choices. In order to do that, do not write commands in the console, but write them in a script, and send them to the console with ^ Ctrl + ⏎ Enter (Windows) or ⌘ Command + ⏎ Enter (MacOS).\n\n\nFirst, we will load a file specifying the different samples, and create an object specifying the location of the count data:\n\nsample_info &lt;- read.csv(\"course_data/sample_info_course.csv\")\ndatadirs &lt;- file.path(\"course_data\", \"count_matrices\", sample_info$SampleName,\n                      \"outs\", \"filtered_feature_bc_matrix\")\nnames(datadirs) &lt;- gsub(\"_\", \"-\", sample_info$SampleName)\ndatadirs &lt;- datadirs[1:3]\n\nThe object datadirs is a named vector specifying the paths of the count directories for each sample:\n\n\n                                                             PBMMC-1 \n\"course_data/count_matrices/PBMMC_1/outs/filtered_feature_bc_matrix\" \n                                                             PBMMC-2 \n\"course_data/count_matrices/PBMMC_2/outs/filtered_feature_bc_matrix\" \n                                                             PBMMC-3 \n\"course_data/count_matrices/PBMMC_3/outs/filtered_feature_bc_matrix\" \n\n\nTo run through a typical Seurat analysis, we will use the files that are in the directory data/filtered_feature_bc_matrix. This directory is part of the output generated by cellranger. To load this data into R and generate a sparse matrix, run the following command:\n\nsparse_matrix &lt;- Seurat::Read10X(data.dir = datadirs)\n\nThis imports a raw count matrix. Have a look at the counts of the first 30 cells of three genes by running:\n\nsparse_matrix[c(\"PECAM1\", \"CD8A\", \"TSPAN1\"), 1:30]\n\n3 x 30 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n\n\n  [[ suppressing 30 column names 'PBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1', 'PBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1', 'PBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1' ... ]]\n\n\n                                                                  \nPECAM1 . . . . . . . 1 . . . . 1 . . 1 . . . . . . . 1 . . . . . .\nCD8A   . 1 . . 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nTSPAN1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n\nYou will see many dots (zeros) and a few integers representing the counts per gene per cell.\nTo generate a Seurat object, we will run CreateSeuratObject. Note that while creating the object, we already do some mild filtering; we only import genes that are expressed in at least 3 cells, and we only import cells that have at least 100 different genes expressed:\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::CreateSeuratObject(counts = sparse_matrix,\n                                  project = \"pbmmc\",\n                                  min.cells = 3,\n                                  min.features = 100)\n\nWarning: Feature names cannot have underscores ('_'), replacing with dashes\n('-')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction notation with ::\n\n\n\nHere, we define the function together with its associated package. We do that by the syntax package::function. Of course, you can also call library(package), and only type the function name. Since we use many different packages in this course, it can be confusing which function comes from which package. Therefore, we chose to always associate the package with the called function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\ncheck what’s in the seu object, by typing seu in the R console. How many features are in there? And how many cells?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nTyping seu should return:\n\n\nAn object of class Seurat \n18673 features across 6946 samples within 1 assay \nActive assay: RNA (18673 features, 0 variable features)\n 1 layer present: counts\n\n\nThis means that we have 18673 genes (features) in there, and 6946 cells (samples)\n\n\n\nThe Seurat object\nThe seu object we have created has the class Seurat. The object contains multi-level slots and lists. Each Seurat object contains exactly the same slots that are specified in the image below (get slot descriptions by typing ?SeuratObject::Seurat). You can get the information inside a slot with @, in the same way as you would use the $ for lists (e.g. seu@meta.data will return the a data frame with information on each cell). Slots can be filled with other R objects, like lists, vectors, data frames or any other class. Here’s an overview of all slots that are in a Seurat object:\n\nIn addition to the original count table, the Seurat object can therefore store a lot of information that is generated during your analysis, like results of a normalization (@assays$RNA@data) a PCA or UMAP (@reductions) and the clustering (@graphs). It also tracks all the commands that have been used to generate the object in its current state (@commands). Therefore, while going through the analysis steps, the same object gets more and more of its slots filled. Because most Seurat functions return the input object + adjusted slots, we can use this syntax:\nseurat_object &lt;- Seurat::function(seurat_object)\nSo, the function takes an object as input and we assign it to an object with the same name. Meaning that we overwrite the object used as input. This is fine in many cases, because Seurat adds information to the input object, and returns is. We will use this syntax for the first time at Normalization and scaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting specific information out of the Seurat object\n\n\n\nIn order to get specific data you can use the @ and $ symbols to browse through the objects. However, Seurat comes with a lot of convenience functions, that are easier to use. So, e.g. to get the raw count matrix, you could type seu@assays$RNA@layers$counts, however, this is equivalent to GetAssayData(object = seu, layer = \"counts\"). More information on these convenience functions here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nA. Have a look at the seu object by running View(seu). What is in there? What is stored in @active.ident?\nB. Have a look at the data.frame stored at seu@meta.data what kind of information is in there?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer A\nThere are many slots as described in the above figure. The slot @active.ident contains data specifying the samples, e.g. table(seu@active.ident) returns:\nPBMMC-1 PBMMC-2 PBMMC-3 \n1612    3105    2229 \nWhich are the number of cells per sample.\nAnswer B\nRunning head(seu@meta.data) returns:\n                            orig.ident nCount_RNA nFeature_RNA\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1    PBMMC-1       2401          909\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1    PBMMC-1       3532          760\nPBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1    PBMMC-1       3972         1215\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAAAGCAGCGTA-1    PBMMC-1       3569          894\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACAATAACGA-1    PBMMC-1       2982          730\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACATCAGTCA-1    PBMMC-1      22284         3108\nGiving you the names of three columns and a row for each cell:\n\n\norig_ident: the original identity (origin) of a cell.\n\nnCount_RNA: the number of reads assigned to a cell.\n\nnFeature_RNA: the number of expressed features (genes) per cell.\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, usually you do not have to dive into this structure to retrieve information. For example, information in the slot @meta.data can be retrieved and set by using $ or [[]].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere is a subtle difference here between $ and [[]]. While $ returns a vector of the column in @meta.data, [[]] returns a data.frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nGenerate a histogram of the column nCount_RNA at seu@meta.data, with the base function hist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(seu$nCount_RNA)\n\n\n\n\nor\n\nhist(seu@meta.data$nCount_RNA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also built-in functions to plot data from Seurat object, for example FeatureScatter. This function enables you easily draw a scatterplot from a Seurat object:\n\nSeurat::FeatureScatter(seu, feature1 = \"nCount_RNA\", feature2 = \"nFeature_RNA\")\n\n\n\n\nYou can find a nice overview of such functions here.\nVisualizing QC per cell and gene\nWhile generating the Seurat object, there were already some quality measures calculated for each cell, namely the total UMI counts per cell (nCount_RNA) and the total number of detected features per cell (nFeature_RNA). We can plot those in a violin plot and evaluate their distribution per sample:\n\nSeurat::VlnPlot(seu, features = c(\"nCount_RNA\",\n                                  \"nFeature_RNA\"))\n\nWarning: Default search for \"data\" layer in \"RNA\" assay yielded no results;\nutilizing \"counts\" layer instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that there is quite a wide range for both. A cell with low number of detected features or counts might not give you a lot of information, while a high number of detected features/counts might point to doublets.\nSingle cells have often undergone sampling and/or dissociation and/or sorting. Therefore, there are often cells and genes in your dataset that cause variation due to technical reasons. In the following steps, we will visualize those and make decisions on whether or not to remove cells or genes with extreme values.\nWe will start with calculating the percentage of counts coming from transcript types:\n\n\nMitochondrial genes: If a cell membrane is damaged, it looses free RNA quicker compared to mitochondrial RNA, because the latter is part of the mitochondrion. A high relative amount of mitochondrial counts can therefore point to damaged cells (Lun et al. 2016).\n\nRibosomal genes: Are not rRNA (ribosomal RNA) but is mRNA that code for ribosomal proteins. They do not point to specific issues, but it can be good to have a look at their relative abundance. They can have biological relevance (e.g. Caron et al. 2020).\n\nHemoglobin genes: these transcripts are very abundant in erythrocytes. Depending on your application, you can expect ‘contamination’ of erythrocytes and select against it.\n\nIn order to have an idea about the relative counts of these type of genes in our dataset, we can calculate their expression as relative counts in each cell. We do that by selecting genes based on patterns (e.g. ^MT- matches with all gene names starting with MT, i.e. mitochondrial genes):\n\n# mitochondrial genes\nseu &lt;- Seurat::PercentageFeatureSet(seu, \n                                    pattern = \"^MT-\", \n                                    col.name = \"percent.mito\")\n\n# ribosomal genes\nseu &lt;- Seurat::PercentageFeatureSet(seu, \n                                    pattern = \"^RP[SL]\",\n                                    col.name = \"percent.ribo\")\n\n# hemoglobin genes (but not HBP)\nseu &lt;- Seurat::PercentageFeatureSet(seu,\n                                    pattern = \"^HB[^(P)]\",\n                                    col.name = \"percent.globin\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nRun the commands and check out the metadata data frame at seu@meta.data. What has changed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we type head(seu@meta.data) it returns:\n\n\n                           orig.ident nCount_RNA nFeature_RNA percent.mito\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1    PBMMC-1       2401          909     2.540608\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1    PBMMC-1       3532          760     5.181200\nPBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1    PBMMC-1       3972         1215     4.934542\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAAAGCAGCGTA-1    PBMMC-1       3569          894     3.250210\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACAATAACGA-1    PBMMC-1       2982          730     3.688799\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACATCAGTCA-1    PBMMC-1      22284         3108     3.181655\n                           percent.ribo percent.globin\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1     28.65473      0.1665973\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1     55.03964      0.1981880\nPBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1     30.43807      0.3776435\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAAAGCAGCGTA-1     55.02942      0.3642477\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACAATAACGA-1     54.49363      0.1006036\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACATCAGTCA-1     23.40693     36.9682283\n\n\nSo, the function PercentageFeatureSet adds a column to meta.data, specifying the percentage of counts for the specified gene sets.\n\n\n\nNow we can plot the distribution of these percentages in a violin plot:\n\nSeurat::VlnPlot(seu, features = c(\"percent.mito\",\n                                  \"percent.ribo\",\n                                  \"percent.globin\"))\n\nWarning: Default search for \"data\" layer in \"RNA\" assay yielded no results;\nutilizing \"counts\" layer instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that PBMMC-2 is quite different from the two others, it has a group of cells with very low ribosomal counts and one with very high globin counts. Maybe these two percentages are negatively correlated? Let’s have a look, by plotting the two percentages against each other:\n\nSeurat::FeatureScatter(seu, \n                       feature1 = \"percent.globin\", \n                       feature2 = \"percent.ribo\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAre they correlated? What kind of cells might have a high abundance of hemoglobin transcripts and low ribosomal transcripts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes there is a negative correlation. Erythrocytes (red blood cells) have a high abundance of hemoglobin transcripts and low abundance of ribosomal transcripts. These are most likely erythroid cells, i.e. the cells predecessing erythrocytes in the bone marrow.\n\n\n\nWe can also evaluate the relative expression of other genes in our dataset, for example, the ones that are most highly expressed. Some very highly expressed genes might point to a technical cause, and we might consider to remove them. Below you will find a simple function to generate a boxplot of relative counts per gene per cell. Load it into your environment and run it on our seu object:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(Matrix)\nlibrary(Seurat)\n\nmost_expressed_boxplot &lt;- function(object, ngenes = 20){\n  \n  # matrix of raw counts\n  cts &lt;- Seurat::GetAssayData(object, assay = \"RNA\", layer = \"counts\")\n  \n  # get percentage/cell\n  cts &lt;- t(cts)/colSums(cts)*100\n  medians &lt;- apply(cts, 2, median)\n  \n  # get top n genes\n  most_expressed &lt;- order(medians, decreasing = T)[ngenes:1]\n  most_exp_matrix &lt;- as.matrix((cts[,most_expressed]))\n  \n  # prepare for plotting\n  most_exp_df &lt;- stack(as.data.frame(most_exp_matrix))\n  colnames(most_exp_df) &lt;- c(\"perc_total\", \"gene\")\n  \n  # boxplot with ggplot2\n  boxplot &lt;- ggplot(most_exp_df, aes(x=gene, y=perc_total)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    coord_flip()\n  return(boxplot)\n}\n\nmost_expressed_boxplot(seu, 20)\n\n\n\n\nAs for most 10X based poly-A enriched single cell datasets, we find a relatively high expression of MALAT1. Many researchers choose to remove it, but it can have biological relevance (e.g. Shaat et al. 2021).\nCell filtering\nBased on the QC process we went through we can come to the following conclusions:\n\nThere are no cells with very high mitochondrial gene counts.\nThere are some cells with a hemoglobin and low ribosomal counts, and these are probably erythrocytes.\nThere are some cells with a very low and very high number of features. These might point to non-informative cells and doublets respectively.\nThe ‘usual suspect’ MALAT1 sometimes makes up a large part of the counts per cell. As we do not see any other suggestions of dying/stressed cells, we leave it in.\n\nIn this case, a sensible decision would be to do mild filtering on the number of features per cell and mitochondrial counts. We can leave the possible erythrocytes in for now, and see where they end up later during the dimensionality reduction.\nIn the M&M of the publication, the authors describe that they have used a threshold of &lt; 8% mitochondrial counts and &gt; 200 features per cell. To filter against possible doublets, here, we also filter out cells with &gt; 5000 detected features/cell. Filtering Seurat objects can be done with the subset method for class SeuratObject:\n\nseu &lt;- subset(seu, subset = nFeature_RNA &gt; 200 & \n                nFeature_RNA &lt; 5000 &\n                percent.mito &lt; 8)\n\nTo evaluate this did the trick we can visualize those parameters again in a violin plot:\n\nSeurat::VlnPlot(seu, features = c(\"nFeature_RNA\",\n                                  \"percent.mito\"))\n\nWarning: Default search for \"data\" layer in \"RNA\" assay yielded no results;\nutilizing \"counts\" layer instead."

For the PCA, by default, only the previously determined variable features are used as input, but can be defined using features argument if you wish to specify a vector of genes. The PCA will only be run on the variable features, that you can check with VariableFeatures(seu).\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::RunPCA(seu)\n\nTo view the PCA plot:\n\nSeurat::DimPlot(seu, reduction = \"pca\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can colour the PCA plot according to any factor that is present in @meta.data, or for any gene. For example we can take the column percent.globin:\n\nSeurat::FeaturePlot(seu, reduction = \"pca\", features = \"percent.globin\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that we used a different plotting function here: FeaturePlot. The difference between DimPlot and FeaturePlot is that the first allows you to color the points in the plot according to a grouping variable (e.g. sample) while the latter allows you to color the points according to a continuous variable (e.g. gene expression).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nGenerate a PCA plot where color is according to counts of a gene (i.e. gene expression). For example, you can take HBA1 (alpha subunit of hemoglobin), or one of the most variable genes (e.g. IGKC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerating a PCA plot coloured according to gene expression (here HBA1):\n\nSeurat::FeaturePlot(seu, reduction = \"pca\", features = \"HBA1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can generate heatmaps according to their principal component scores calculated in the rotation matrix:\n\nSeurat::DimHeatmap(seu, dims = 1:12, cells = 500, balanced = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nThe elbowplot can help you in determining how many PCs to use for downstream analysis such as UMAP:\n\nSeurat::ElbowPlot(seu, ndims = 40)\n\n\n\n\nThe elbow plot ranks principle components based on the percentage of variance explained by each one. Where we observe an “elbow” or flattening curve, the majority of true signal is captured by this number of PCs, eg around 25 PCs for the seu dataset.\nIncluding too many PCs usually does not affect much the result, while including too few PCs can affect the results very much.\nUMAP: The goal of these algorithms is to learn the underlying manifold of the data in order to place similar cells together in low-dimensional space.\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::RunUMAP(seu, dims = 1:25)\n\nTo view the UMAP plot:\n\nSeurat::DimPlot(seu, reduction = \"umap\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nTry to change:\nA. Color the dots in the UMAP according to a variable (e.g. percent.globin or HBA1). Any idea where the erythrocytes probably are in the UMAP?\nB. The number of neighbors used for the calculation of the UMAP. Which is the parameter to change and how did it affect the output. What is the default ? In which situation would you lower/increase this ?\nC. The number of dims to extremes dims = 1:5 or dims = 1:50 how did it affect the output ? In your opinion better few PCAs too much or too few ? Why does dims = 1:100 not work? When would more precision be needed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer A\n\nSeurat::FeaturePlot(seu, features = c(\"HBA1\",\n                                      \"percent.globin\",\n                                      \"IGKC\",\n                                      \"percent.mito\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe erythrocytes are probably in the cluster with a higher percentage of globin expression.\nAnswer B\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::RunUMAP(seu, dims = 1:25, n.neighbors = 5)\n\n\nSeurat::DimPlot(seu, reduction = \"umap\")\n\n\n\n\nThe default number of neighbours is 30. It can be of interest to change the number of neighbors if one has subset the data (for instance in the situation where you would only consider the t-cells inyour data set), then maybe the number of neighbors in a cluster would anyway be most of the time lower than 30 then 30 is too much. In the other extreme where your dataset is extremely big an increase in the number of neighbors can be considered.\nAnswer C\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::RunUMAP(seu, dims = 1:5)\n\n\nSeurat::DimPlot(seu, reduction = \"umap\")\n\n\n\n\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::RunUMAP(seu, dims = 1:50) \n\n\nSeurat::DimPlot(seu, reduction = \"umap\")\n\n\n\n\nTaking dims = 1:100 does not work as in the step RunPCA by default only 50pcs are calculated, so the maximum that we can consider in further steps are 50, if more precision makes sense, for instance, if the genes that is of interest for your study is not present when the RunPCA was calculated, then an increase in the number of components calculated at start might be interesting tobe considered. Taking too few PCs we have a « blob » everything looks connected. Too many PCs tends to separate everything. Personally it is more interesting for me too have maybe 2 clusters separated of epithelial cells that I then group for further downstream analysis rather than having very distinct cells being clustered together. So I would rather take the « elbow » of the elbow plot a bit further to the right.\n\n\n\n\nAfter having done these exercises, change the UMAP back to a UMAP based on the first 25 PCs, in order to replicate the exercises in the following chapters. Do this by:\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::RunUMAP(seu, dims = 1:25)"

This step is performed using the FindNeighbors() function, and takes as input the previously defined dimensionality of the dataset.\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::FindNeighbors(seu, dims = 1:25, reduction = \"integrated.cca\")\n\nTo cluster the cells, Seurat next implements modularity optimization techniques such as the Louvain algorithm (default) or SLM [SLM, Blondel et al., Journal of Statistical Mechanics], to iteratively group cells together, with the goal of optimizing the standard modularity function. The FindClusters() function implements this procedure, and contains a resolution parameter that sets the ‘granularity’ of the downstream clustering, with increased values leading to a greater number of clusters.\n\nseu &lt;- Seurat::FindClusters(seu, resolution = seq(0.1, 0.8, by=0.1))\n\nCluster id of each cell is added to the metadata object, as a new column for each resolution tested:\n\nhead(seu@meta.data)\n\n                           orig.ident nCount_RNA nFeature_RNA percent.mito\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1    PBMMC-1       2401          909     2.540608\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1    PBMMC-1       3532          760     5.181200\nPBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1    PBMMC-1       3972         1215     4.934542\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAAAGCAGCGTA-1    PBMMC-1       3569          894     3.250210\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACAATAACGA-1    PBMMC-1       2982          730     3.688799\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACATCAGTCA-1    PBMMC-1      22284         3108     3.181655\n                           percent.ribo percent.globin nCount_SCT nFeature_SCT\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1     28.65473      0.1665973       4135          911\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1     55.03964      0.1981880       4401          759\nPBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1     30.43807      0.3776435       4372         1215\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAAAGCAGCGTA-1     55.02942      0.3642477       4362          894\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACAATAACGA-1     54.49363      0.1006036       4295          731\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACATCAGTCA-1     23.40693     36.9682283       4557         1058\n                           RNA_snn_res.0.1 RNA_snn_res.0.2 RNA_snn_res.0.3\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1               5               7               7\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1               0               0               0\nPBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1               2               3               3\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAAAGCAGCGTA-1               0               0               0\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACAATAACGA-1               0               0               0\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACATCAGTCA-1               4               2               2\n                           RNA_snn_res.0.4 RNA_snn_res.0.5 RNA_snn_res.0.6\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1               7               7               7\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1               0               0               0\nPBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1               2               3               3\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAAAGCAGCGTA-1               0               0               0\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACAATAACGA-1               0               0               0\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACATCAGTCA-1               5               5               5\n                           RNA_snn_res.0.7 RNA_snn_res.0.8 seurat_clusters\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGCAGACGCAA-1               9               8               8\nPBMMC-1_AAACCTGTCATCACCC-1               0               0               0\nPBMMC-1_AAAGATGCATAAAGGT-1               2               2               2\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAAAGCAGCGTA-1               0               0               0\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACAATAACGA-1               0               0               0\nPBMMC-1_AAAGCAACATCAGTCA-1               5               5               5\n\n\nTo view how clusters sub-divide at increasing resolution:\n\nlibrary(clustree)\n\nLoading required package: ggraph\n\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\nclustree::clustree(seu@meta.data[,grep(\"RNA_snn_res\", colnames(seu@meta.data))],\n                   prefix = \"RNA_snn_res.\")\n\n\n\n\nYou can view the UMAP coloring each cell according to a cluster id like this:\n\nSeurat::DimPlot(seu, group.by = \"RNA_snn_res.0.1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nVisualise clustering based on a few more resolutions.

If one has reasons to change the number of neighbors in the UMAP function, here the same parameter should be adapted.\nThe method can be changed with algorithm = 2,3 or 4"

an explanation of the log fold change have a look at ?Seurat::FindMarkers.

It doesn’t allow you to run paired-sample T tests for example.\nFor more complex designs, we can use edgeR or limma which are designed for microarray or bulk RNA seq data and provide a design matrix that includes covariates for example, or sample IDs for paired analyses.\nWe will load an object containing only pro B cells, both from healthy tissues (PBMMC), and malignant tissues (ETV6-RUNX1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease NOTE that in the original design of this data set, the healthy and malignant tissues were not patient-matched, i.e. the real design was not the one of paired healthy and malignant tissues. However, for demonstration purposes, we will show you how to run a paired analysis, and do as if the PBMMC-1 and ETV6-RUNX1-1 samples both came from the same patient 1, the PBMMC-2 and ETV6-RUNX1-2 samples both came from the same patient 2, etc…\n\n\nWe can load the object and explore its UMAP and meta.data like this:\n\nproB &lt;- readRDS(\"course_data/proB.rds\")\n\nSeurat::DimPlot(proB, group.by = \"orig.ident\")\n\n\n\ntable(proB@meta.data$type)\n\n\nETV6-RUNX1      PBMMC \n      2000       1021 \n\nhead(proB@meta.data)\n\n                           orig.ident nCount_RNA nFeature_RNA    SingleR_annot\nPBMMC-1_AAATGCCAGACTGGGT-1    PBMMC-1       4886         1727 Pro-B_cell_CD34+\nPBMMC-1_AAATGCCTCCACTGGG-1    PBMMC-1       8397         2291 Pro-B_cell_CD34+\nPBMMC-1_AACACGTTCTTGACGA-1    PBMMC-1       3444         1204 Pro-B_cell_CD34+\nPBMMC-1_AACCATGAGAAGGTGA-1    PBMMC-1       8981         2437 Pro-B_cell_CD34+\nPBMMC-1_AACCGCGCATGGTCAT-1    PBMMC-1       3719         1368 Pro-B_cell_CD34+\nPBMMC-1_AAGCCGCCAGACGTAG-1    PBMMC-1       4573         1464 Pro-B_cell_CD34+\n                            type\nPBMMC-1_AAATGCCAGACTGGGT-1 PBMMC\nPBMMC-1_AAATGCCTCCACTGGG-1 PBMMC\nPBMMC-1_AACACGTTCTTGACGA-1 PBMMC\nPBMMC-1_AACCATGAGAAGGTGA-1 PBMMC\nPBMMC-1_AACCGCGCATGGTCAT-1 PBMMC\nPBMMC-1_AAGCCGCCAGACGTAG-1 PBMMC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want to know how this pro-B cell subset is generated, have a look at the script here.\n\n\nLet’s have a look at the UMAP (again), coloured by celltype:\n\nSeurat::DimPlot(proB, group.by = \"type\")\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say we are specifically interested to test for differential gene expression between the tumor and normal samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHere we could also test for e.g. healthy versus diseased within a celltype/cluster.\n\n\nNow we will run differential expression analysis between tumor and healthy cells using the patient ID as a covariate by using limma.\nPrepare the pseudobulk count matrix:\n\n#taking the proB data \nSeurat::DefaultAssay(proB) &lt;- \"RNA\"\nSeurat::Idents(proB) &lt;- proB$orig.ident\n\n## add the patient id also for paired DGE\nproB$patient.id&lt;-gsub(\"ETV6-RUNX1\", \"ETV6_RUNX1\", proB$orig.ident)\nproB$patient.id&lt;-sapply(strsplit(proB$patient.id, \"-\"), '[', 2)\n\n## Here we do perform pseudo-bulk:\n##first a mandatory column of sample needs to be added to the meta data that is the grouping factor, should be the samples\nproB$sample &lt;- factor(proB$orig.ident)\n\n# aggergate the cells per sampple\nbulk &lt;- Seurat::AggregateExpression(proB, group.by = \"sample\",\n                                    return.seurat = TRUE,\n                                    assay = \"RNA\")\n\n# create a metadata data frame based on the aggregated cells\nmeta_data &lt;- unique(proB@meta.data[, c(\"orig.ident\",\n                                            \"sample\", \"type\",\n                                            \"patient.id\")])\nrownames(meta_data) &lt;- meta_data$orig.ident\nbulk@meta.data &lt;- meta_data[colnames(bulk), ]\n\n\n##have a look at the counts\ncounts &lt;- Seurat::GetAssayData(bulk, layer = \"counts\") |&gt; as.matrix()\n\nhead(counts)\n\n              ETV6-RUNX1-1 ETV6-RUNX1-2 ETV6-RUNX1-3 PBMMC-1 PBMMC-2 PBMMC-3\nRP11-34P13.7             0            0            0       2       0       0\nFO538757.3               0            0            0       0       0       0\nFO538757.2             138          275           74     129      40     112\nAP006222.2              63           43           17      38      19      26\nRP4-669L17.10            5           10            3       0       1       1\nRP5-857K21.4             0            0            0       0       0       2\n\n#have a look at the colData of our new object summed, can you see type and \n#patient.id are there\nhead(bulk@meta.data)\n\n               orig.ident       sample       type patient.id\nETV6-RUNX1-1 ETV6-RUNX1-1 ETV6-RUNX1-1 ETV6-RUNX1          1\nETV6-RUNX1-2 ETV6-RUNX1-2 ETV6-RUNX1-2 ETV6-RUNX1          2\nETV6-RUNX1-3 ETV6-RUNX1-3 ETV6-RUNX1-3 ETV6-RUNX1          3\nPBMMC-1           PBMMC-1      PBMMC-1      PBMMC          1\nPBMMC-2           PBMMC-2      PBMMC-2      PBMMC          2\nPBMMC-3           PBMMC-3      PBMMC-3      PBMMC          3\n\n\nGenerate a DGEList object to use as input for limma and filter the genes to remove lowly expressed genes.

Since we have included the Seurat clustering, we can plot the PCA, with colors according to these clusters:\n\nPCAplot_slingshot(sce,\n                  variable = deng_SCE$Seurat_clusters,\n                  type = 'lineages',\n                  col = 'black',\n                  legend = TRUE)\n\n\n\nPCAplot_slingshot(sce,\n                  variable = deng_SCE$cell_type2,\n                  type = 'lineages',\n                  col = 'black',\n                  legend = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nInstead of providing an initial cluster, think of an end cluster that would fit this trajectory analysis and perform the slingshot analysis.

First load the seu dataset:\n\nseu &lt;- readRDS(\"seu_day2-4.rds\")\n\nLoad the required package into your environment:\n\nlibrary(monocle3)\n\nGenerate a monocle3 object (with class cell_data_set) from our Seurat object:\n\n# create gene metadata data.frame\nfeature_names &lt;- as.data.frame(rownames(seu))\nrownames(feature_names) &lt;- rownames(seu)\ncolnames(feature_names) &lt;- \"gene_short_name\"\n\n# initiate monocle object from seurat count table \nseu_monocl &lt;- monocle3::new_cell_data_set(Seurat::GetAssayData(seu,\n                                                               layer = \"counts\"),\n                                          cell_metadata = seu@meta.data,\n                                          gene_metadata = feature_names)\n\nWe pre-process the newly created object. What does it involve? Check:\n\n?preprocess_cds\n\nPreprocess the dataset:\n\nseu_monocl &lt;- monocle3::preprocess_cds(seu_monocl)\n\nAnd check out the elbow plot:\n\nmonocle3::plot_pc_variance_explained(seu_monocl)\n\n\n\n\nPerform UMAP using the implementation in the monocle3 package and its default parameters:\n\nseu_monocl &lt;- monocle3::reduce_dimension(seu_monocl, reduction_method = \"UMAP\")\n\nPlot the monocle3 UMAP coloring cells according to the cluster ID, marker gene or annotation that were stored in the Seurat object:\n\nmonocle3::plot_cells(seu_monocl, \n                     color_cells_by = \"RNA_snn_res.0.3\", \n                     cell_size = 1, \n                     show_trajectory_graph = FALSE)\n\n\n\nmonocle3::plot_cells(seu_monocl, genes = \"CD79A\", \n                     cell_size = 1,\n                     show_trajectory_graph = FALSE,\n                     scale_to_range = FALSE)\n\n\n\nmonocle3::plot_cells(seu_monocl, \n                     color_cells_by = \"SingleR_annot\", \n                     cell_size = 1, \n                     show_trajectory_graph = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nCluster cells using monocle3’s clustering function:\n\nseu_monocl &lt;- monocle3::cluster_cells(seu_monocl, resolution=0.00025)\nmonocle3::plot_cells(seu_monocl, label_cell_groups = F)\n\nNo trajectory to plot. Has learn_graph() been called yet?\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn graph (i.e. identify trajectory) using monocle3 UMAP and clustering:\n\nseu_monocl &lt;- monocle3::learn_graph(seu_monocl)\n\n\nmonocle3::plot_cells(seu_monocl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nFind the CD34+ B-cell cluster in the monocle UMAP. This cluster has a high expressession of CD79A and expresses CD34.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmonocle3::plot_cells(seu_monocl, genes = c(\"CD79A\", \"CD34\"),\n                     show_trajectory_graph = FALSE, \n                     cell_size = 0.7, group_label_size = 4)\n\n\n\n\nCluster 11 has both a high expression of CD79A and CD34.\n\n\n\nSelect the “initial” cells in the B-cell cluster to calculate pseudotime. The initial cells in this case are the CD34+ B-cells we have just identified. A pop up window will open and you need to click on the “initial” cells (one node per trajectory), then click “Done”.\n\nseu_monocl &lt;- monocle3::order_cells(seu_monocl)\n\n\nmonocle3::plot_cells(seu_monocl,\n                     color_cells_by = \"pseudotime\",\n                     label_cell_groups=F,\n                     label_leaves=F,\n                     label_branch_points=FALSE,\n                     graph_label_size=1.5, cell_size = 1)\n\n\n\n\nIn order to find genes which expression is affected by pseudtime, we first have to isolate the B-cell cluster. Therefore, extract all cells in the B-cell cluster with the interactive choose_cells function:\n\nseuB &lt;- choose_cells(seu_monocl)\n\nCheck whether you have selected the right cells:\n\nplot_cells(seuB, show_trajectory_graph = FALSE, cell_size = 1,\n           color_cells_by = \"pseudotime\")\n\nCells aren't colored in a way that allows them to be grouped.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can use the cells in this trajectory to test which genes are affected by the trajectory:\n\npr_test &lt;- graph_test(seuB, \n                      cores=4, \n                      neighbor_graph = \"principal_graph\")\n\n\n# order by test statistic\npr_test &lt;- pr_test[order(pr_test$morans_test_statistic, \n                         decreasing = TRUE),]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus\np_value\nmorans_test_statistic\nmorans_I\ngene_short_name\nq_value\n\n\n\nHBB\nOK\n0\n101.29233\n0.8472319\nHBB\n0\n\n\nHBA2\nOK\n0\n100.44956\n0.8405222\nHBA2\n0\n\n\nPTMA\nOK\n0\n91.60811\n0.7662323\nPTMA\n0\n\n\nHBA1\nOK\n0\n91.58533\n0.7663894\nHBA1\n0\n\n\nSTMN1\nOK\n0\n86.86541\n0.7263461\nSTMN1\n0\n\n\nTOP2A\nOK\n0\n84.45458\n0.7067213\nTOP2A\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView(pr_test)\n\nThere are some interesting genes in there, for example related to cell cycling (MKI67, CKS2), related to B-cell development (CD34, MS4A1) and immunoglobulins (IGLL1 and IGLL5). We can plot those in the UMAP:\n\ngoi &lt;- c(\"CD34\", \"MS4A1\", \"IGLL1\", \"IGLL5\", \n         \"MKI67\", \"CKS2\")\nplot_cells(seuB, label_cell_groups=FALSE, genes = goi,\n           show_trajectory_graph=FALSE, cell_size = 1)\n\n\n\n\nBut also against pseudotime:\n\nseuB@colData$monocle_cluster &lt;- clusters(seuB)\n\nplot_genes_in_pseudotime(subset(seuB, \n                                rowData(seuB)$gene_short_name %in% goi),\n                         min_expr=0.5, color_cells_by = \"monocle_cluster\")"
