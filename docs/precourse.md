## UNIX

As is stated in the course prerequisites at the [announcement web page](https://www.sib.swiss/training/), we expect participants to have a basic understanding of working with the command line on UNIX-based systems. You can test your UNIX skills with a quiz [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2BEWeOKLbIRGBT_aDEGPce1FOaVYBbhBiaqcaHoBKNB27MQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). If you don't have experience with UNIX command line, or if you're unsure whether you meet the prerequisites, follow our [online UNIX tutorial](https://edu.sib.swiss/pluginfile.php/2878/mod_resource/content/4/couselab-html/content.html).

## Software

We will be mainly working on an Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/))  Elastic Cloud (EC2) server. Our Ubuntu server behaves like a 'normal' remote server, and can be approached through `ssh` with a username, key and IP address. All participants will be granted access to a personal home directory.

Before the course, make sure you can comfortably work on a remote server. This means that you can approach it through the shell, modify scripts and transfer files. We can recommend `atom` for Linux and Mac, and `Notepad ++` in combination with MobaXterm for Windows. We will be visualising our results with IGV. Therefore, install in your computer:

=== "mac OS/Linux"
    * SSH and scripting: [Atom](https://atom.io/) with packages like: [`terminus`](https://atom.io/packages/terminus) and [`ftp-remote-edit`](https://atom.io/packages/ftp-remote-edit)
    * Transferring files: [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
    * [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)

=== "Windows"
    * SSH and scripting: [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ "get MobaXterm") and/or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) with the plugin `NppFTP`
    * Transferring files: [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
    * [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)
